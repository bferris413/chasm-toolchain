# chasm
An independent toolchain, initially targetting embedded ARM.

## Motivation
chasm (and the related [metal-arm](https://github.com/bferris413/metal-arm) repo) is my vehicle for learning
native compiler toolchain and embedded development "from scratch."

The projects in metal-arm are currently the main driver for features implemented here. Cortex-M4F is the
only supported target at the moment.
